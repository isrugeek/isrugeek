### Hey 👋, Welcome to my Zone!

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Chapa as a CTO.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Human brains!
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate on ML and Fintech projects.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help

- ⚡ Fun fact: “So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.” - Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)


I’m most interested in real-world machine learning problems, especially applying Deep learning algorithms to solve numerous Biology and Physics problems. I believe that we could able to create an algorithm to predict some funny questions like “What if Einstein was still alive with today’s technology? How far in science would we be? Would we have started time travel?”.



P.S If you want to talk about Quantum Neural Network or Energy efficient Deep learning Models, let me know.
